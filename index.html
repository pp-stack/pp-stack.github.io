            <h1>Branches of software development</h1>
            <p>If we ask a person “What does a software developer do?” the first answer that might pop into mind is develop mobile apps or websites, as it is the most common place a regular person encounters the work of a developer, but in reality, it is only one of the software development branches.</p>
            <p>In todays world, we meet various software in our daily lives in places our ancestor could not even dream of - from street billboards, smart fridges or watches that can keep track of blood pressure to cars that can drive on their own. As the demand for gadgets that simplify our daily lives is ever-growing so is the need for qualified software developers. </p>
            <p>As there is not a “one that does all” solution in software development, there are different branches of which the developer might specialize in. Below you can see some of the software development branches according to Wikipedia, but there are also sub-categories so if one of these branches sparks interest, make sure to search for more information from web.</p>
